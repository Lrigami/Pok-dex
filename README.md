## About this project

This project is a group exercise (in pairs) that we had to complete in less than 4 hours.
The aim of this exercise was to create a pokédex (structure and style) that was at least static.
The pokédex had to display a pokémon with its number, its name, an image, its types and several description elements.

We decided to use the Pokebuild API to generate the pokémon data automatically.
We added a search bar so that users could immediately look up the data linked to a particular pokémon.
We also decided to add navigation arrows to navigate through the pokédex, just like in the Pokémon games. The order in which the data is displayed depends on the pokémon id.
